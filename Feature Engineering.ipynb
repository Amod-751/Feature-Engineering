    "1.What is a parameter?\n",
    "    ->A parameter in ML is an internal variable that a model learns from the training data.\n",
    "        These are the values that define how the model makes predictions.\n",
    "        The learning algorithm adjusts parameters to minimize error (loss function).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Examples of Parameters in ML\n",
    "\n",
    "        Linear Regression:-\n",
    "\n",
    "        y = wx + b\n",
    "\n",
    "        w (weight/slope) and b (bias/intercept) are parameters that the algorithm learns during training to find the best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Logistic Regression:-\n",
    "\n",
    "        The coefficients (w) determine how strongly each feature influences the probability prediction and are considered parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Neural Networks:-\n",
    "\n",
    "        Each connection weight and bias in the network acts as a parameter. Deep learning models can contain millions or even billions of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Decision Trees:-\n",
    "\n",
    "        The split points and thresholds at each node are treated as parameters.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "2.What is correlation?\n",
    "What does negative correlation mean?\n",
    "    ->In machine learning, correlation describes the statistical relationship between features (independent variables) or between a feature and the target variable.\n",
    "    It measures how strongly two variables move together.\n",
    "    A correlation coefficient (usually Pearson’s r) tells us the strength (magnitude) and direction (positive or negative) of that relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Why it matters in ML:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Feature selection: Highly correlated features may be redundant (multicollinearity).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Understanding data: Correlation between features and the target helps identify useful predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Interpretability: Explains why a model might weigh features in a certain way.\n",
    "\n",
    "     What does Negative Correlation Mean in ML?\n",
    "\n",
    "        A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "        In ML, if a feature has a negative correlation with the target, it means higher values of that feature are associated with lower target values (and vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples in ML:\n",
    "\n",
    "        =>House Prices Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "            Feature: Distance from city center\n",
    "\n",
    "            Target: House price\n",
    "\n",
    "            Relationship: Negative correlation (farther from the city → lower price).\n",

    "\n",
    "            Feature: Job satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "            Target: Probability of quitting\n",
    "\n",
    "            Relationship: Negative correlation (higher satisfaction → lower chance of quitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "        =>Medical Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "            Feature: Exercise per week\n",
    "\n",
    "            Target: Risk of heart disease\n",
    "\n",
    "            Relationship: Negative correlation (more exercise → lower risk).\n",

    "3.Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
    "    ->Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on creating algorithms and models that can learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "        In simple words:\n",
    "          Instead of writing rules manually, we feed data to a machine, and it learns rules/patterns automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "          Main Components in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "        A typical ML system has 4 main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "        The foundation of ML — raw information used for training and testing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Training data → used to teach the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Validation data → used to tune hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Test data → used to evaluate performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "          Example: Customer purchase history, images, medical records.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. Model\n",
    "\n",
    "        The mathematical structure/algorithm that makes predictions or decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "        It defines the relationship between input features and output target.\n",
    "\n",
    "          Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Linear Regression model: predicts house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Neural Network: recognizes handwritten digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. Learning Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "        The method/process used to adjust the model’s parameters (weights, biases) based on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Goal: Minimize error (loss function) and improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "          Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Gradient Descent (optimizes weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Backpropagation (used in neural networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "        4. Prediction / Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "        Once trained, the model is used to predict outputs for new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "        This is the real-world application of the ML system.\n",
    "\n",
    "          Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Predicting whether an email is spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Recommending movies on Netflix.\n",
    "\n",
    "        (Optional but Important) Supporting Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Features → The input variables (e.g., age, income, image pixels).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Loss function → Measures error between predictions and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Evaluation metrics → Accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
    "    ->The loss function, also known as the cost function, measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values (ground truth). \n",
    "      It indicates how poorly the model is performing—smaller loss means better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "        For example, in regression, Mean Squared Error (MSE) is commonly used:  \n",
    "        Loss = (1/n) Σ(y_true - y_pred)².  \n",
    "        If the predictions are close to the actual values, the loss will be small.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Loss plays a crucial role in determining model quality:  \n",
    "\n",
    "        - Training Guidance: The optimizer, like gradient descent, uses the loss value to adjust the model's parameters (weights and biases). A lower loss shows the model is learning meaningful patterns.  \n",
    "        - Model Comparison: Loss values can compare different models or hyperparameters. A consistently lower loss on validation or test data indicates a better model.  \n",
    "        - Overfitting/Underfitting Detection:  \n",
    "          - Training loss ↓, Validation loss ↓ → Good fit.  \n",
    "          - Training loss ↓, Validation loss ↑ → Overfitting (memorizing training data).  \n",
    "          - High training and validation loss → Underfitting (model too simple).  \n",
    "        - Early Stopping & Monitoring: In deep learning, loss curves help determine when to stop training to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
    "    ->1. Continuous Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "        A continuous variable can take any value within a range (including decimals/fractions).\n",
    "\n",
    "        They are measured, not counted.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Infinite possible values between two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "            Height (e.g., 172.3 cm)\n",
    "\n",
    "            Weight (e.g., 65.8 kg)\n",
    "\n",
    "            Temperature (e.g., 36.6 °C)\n",
    "\n",
    "            Time taken to finish a race (e.g., 12.54 seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "     In ML: Continuous variables are often treated as numerical features and used in regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "     2. Categorical Variables:-\n",
    "\n",
    "        A categorical variable represents distinct groups or categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "        They are counted, not measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Values are qualitative, not numerical (though sometimes encoded as numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Types of Categorical Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Nominal (no order):\n",
    "\n",
    "            Example: Colors (red, blue, green), Gender (male, female).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Ordinal (with order/ranking):\n",
    "\n",
    "            Example: Education level (High school < Bachelor < Master < PhD).\n",
    "\n",
    "            Example: Customer satisfaction (Poor < Fair < Good < Excellent).\n",
    "\n",
    "        In ML: Categorical variables need encoding (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding) before being fed into models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6.How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
    "    ->Models like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks, etc., require numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Categorical features (like color = red/blue/green) must be encoded into numeric form without losing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Common Techniques to Handle Categorical Variables\n",
    "        1. Label Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "        Converts each category into an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "          Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Color: Red → 0, Blue → 1, Green → 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "          Pros: Simple, memory-efficient.\n",
    "          Cons: Implies ordinal relationship (0 < 1 < 2), which may mislead models.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "        Creates binary columns (0/1) for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "          Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Color: Red → [1,0,0], Blue → [0,1,0], Green → [0,0,1]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "          Pros: No false ordering, widely used.\n",
    "          Cons: Can cause high dimensionality if many categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. Ordinal Encoding (for ordered categories)\n",
    "\n",
    "        Assigns integers based on order/rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "          Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Size: Small → 1, Medium → 2, Large → 3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "          Pros: Preserves natural order.\n",
    "          Cons: Not suitable if categories have no ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "        4. Frequency / Count Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "        Replace each category with its frequency/count in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "          Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        City: Mumbai (100), Delhi (80), Bangalore (60)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "          Pros: Keeps some information about distribution.\n",
    "          Cons: Can still mislead models into thinking higher frequency means more importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "        5. Target Encoding (Mean Encoding)\n",
    "\n",
    "        Replace each category with the mean of target variable for that category.\n",
    "\n",
    "           Example: Predicting loan approval → replace “Job Title” with average approval rate for that job.\n",
    "           Pros: Useful for high-cardinality features.\n",
    "           Cons: Risk of data leakage (must use CV).\n",
    "\n",
    "        6. Embedding Representations (Deep Learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "        Learn a dense vector representation for categories (used in neural networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Common in NLP (word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe).\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "7.What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
    "    ->1. Training Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "        The portion of data used to teach the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "        The model looks at the input features (X) and corresponding output labels (y) and learns patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "        During training, the algorithm adjusts its parameters (like weights, biases) to minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "            Data: House size, number of rooms → House price\n",
    "\n",
    "            Training: Model learns the relationship between features (size, rooms) and target (price).\n",
    "\n",
    "     2. Testing Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "        The unseen portion of data used to evaluate the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "        It checks whether the model has actually learned general patterns (not just memorized training data).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Performance on the test set tells us if the model can generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "            After training on 80% of housing data, we test on the remaining 20% to see how well the model predicts prices of houses it hasn’t seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Why Split into Training and Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "            If we train and test on the same data, the model may perform well (low loss) but fail on new data → this is called overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "            Splitting ensures we evaluate true predictive ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Typical Dataset Splits\n",
    "\n",
    "            Training set: 70–80%\n",
    "\n",
    "            Testing set: 20–30%\n",
    "\n",
    "            Sometimes, we also use a Validation set (10–20%) to tune hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "             Or we use cross-validation instead of a fixed split.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Quick Analogy\n",
    "\n",

    "11.Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
    "    ->Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing and visualizing data to understand its structure, patterns, and relationships before building a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Performing EDA is important because it helps in several key ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "        => Understand Data Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "            EDA helps us see how features are distributed (normal, skewed, uniform, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "            Knowing the distribution allows us to choose appropriate preprocessing steps (like scaling, normalization, or transformation).\n",
    "\n",
    "            Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "                A highly skewed feature might need log transformation before training a regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "        => Detect and Handle Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "            Real-world datasets often have missing or null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "            EDA helps identify missing data and decide how to handle it:\n",
    "\n",
    "            Drop rows/columns\n",
    "\n",
    "            Impute with mean, median, mode, or predictive methods\n",
    "\n",
    "        => Identify Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "            Outliers can distort model training and reduce performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "            EDA helps spot extreme values using visualizations like boxplots or scatter plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "        => Discover Relationships Between Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "            EDA helps understand correlations and interactions between features and target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "            This can guide feature selection and reduce multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "            Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "                A feature highly correlated with the target is likely useful for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "                Features strongly correlated with each other may need dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "        => Detect Data Quality Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "            EDA reveals inconsistencies, duplicate records, or errors in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "            Fixing these ensures the model learns true patterns rather than noise.\n",

    "            EDA provides insights for creating new features or transforming existing features to improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "        => Choose the Right Model\n",
    "\n",
    "            Based on the patterns observed during EDA, you can decide whether to use:\n",

    "        Feature selection: Highly correlated features may be redundant (multicollinearity).\n",

    "        Interpretability: Explains why a model might weigh features in a certain way.\n",

    "    ->A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "        In ML, if a feature has a negative correlation with the target, it means higher values of that feature are associated with lower target values (and vice versa).\n",
